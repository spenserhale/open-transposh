 * Open Transposh
 *
 * The Open Transposh Plugin is an open-source fork of the Transposh Plugin. The fork's existence stemmed from the
 * original Transposh author, who disagreed with security experts and chose not to fix the reported issues.
 * WordPress removed the plugin from their official plugin directory. This plugin resolves the reported issues to allow
 * the WordPress community to continue to use this plugin securely and access to download from the WordPress plugin
 * directory. The plugin is a drop in replacement and uses the same data identifiers for compatibility.
